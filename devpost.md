## Inspiration
Certain populations are at higher risk of phishing than others, the elderly, CS students desperate for a job, children who think they just won free Robux. However, these populations are often times the groups that receive the least amount of training to prevent phishing attacks, as usually older office workers receive training for this from their companies. We want to close this disparity!

## What it does
PhishSchool is an interactive, easy-to-use platform designed to help users detect and defend against phishing attempts. It allows users to upload any text, image, or email they suspect might be malicious and returns a phishing-likelihood score along with an explanation of what made the content suspicious. Beyond detection, PhishSchool also includes immediate training opportunities that teach users to recognize common phishing patterns. For continued education, users can opt into regular phishing simulations that send realistic fake emails to keep them alert and reinforce what they’ve learned.

## How we built it
We built PhishSchool using a modern, full-stack web development approach that combines responsive design with intelligent analysis. Our frontend was developed with Vite, React, and TypeScript, styled using TailwindCSS to ensure a fast, responsive, and accessible user experience. On the backend, we integrated Node.js, FastAPI, and Supabase to handle authentication, data storage, and communication between the client and server. For phishing detection and analysis, we leveraged the Gemini API, a multimodal large language model capable of understanding and analyzing diverse file formatsto identify potential phishing characteristics. We also have our own internal tables of verified domains to aid in checking for phishing attacks. Finally, we deployed the entire application on Vercel, enabling reliable hosting, seamless versioning, and quick iteration during development.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges we faced early on was coordinating through Git and managing our collaboration workflow. Many of us were new to working together on a shared repository, and we initially struggled with merge conflicts, version control, and organization. Over time, we overcame these obstacles by learning on the spot, seeking help from mentors and peers, and improving our communication as a team. We also encountered numerous technical challenges since there were many things we did not know how to implement at first, but persistence, research, and teamwork helped us find solutions. Another early hurdle was deciding on a project idea. Each of us was interested in a different track, which made it difficult to align our goals, but after discussion, we all agreed on the "Protecting N00bs" theme and were excited to build something meaningful under that direction.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of how much we learned and accomplished throughout the development of PhishSchool. One of our biggest achievements was successfully applying agile principles and maintaining an organized Git workflow, which greatly improved our collaboration and efficiency. All of us gained valuable hands-on experience and learned new technical skills that went beyond the theory we usually study at BU. It was also the first time some members of our team had worked on a collaborative software project, making this a rewarding and eye-opening experience. Overall, we are proud of how we transformed our classroom knowledge into a functional, real-world application that helps others stay safe online.

## What we learned
Throughout this project, we learned the importance of effective teamwork and agile development practices. Managing our Git repository taught us how to collaborate efficiently and handle version control in a real-world environment. We also gained hands-on experience working with RESTful APIs and database management, including creating and maintaining CRUD operations. In addition, we deepened our understanding of large language models and how to integrate them into full-stack applications. Overall, this project strengthened both our technical and collaborative skills, allowing us to grow as developers and as a team.

## What's next for PhishSchool
Looking ahead, we plan to continue improving PhishSchool to make it even more effective, scalable, and accessible. With more resources, we aim to strengthen our phishing detection capabilities and improve the accuracy and reliability of our learning questions. This would also allow us to generate more consistent and realistic example phishing attacks for users to learn from. We plan to expand our simulated training system by introducing multiple fake domain emails, allowing for more authentic testing scenarios and more engaging user experiences.

In addition, we hope to enhance our phishing education platform by introducing gamified learning modules, progress tracking, and achievement badges to keep users motivated. We would also like to launch a browser extension or email plugin to provide real-time phishing detection and instant feedback within users’ inboxes. Finally, we plan to partner with schools, community centers, and cybersecurity organizations to make phishing awareness training more accessible to at-risk populations and ensure that online safety education reaches everyone.
